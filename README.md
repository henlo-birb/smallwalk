# smallwalk
source for my game smallwalk, available on itch at https://henlo-birb.itch.io/smallwalk, created for Not Like Other Games 2022 and the Queerness and Games class.

i wrote this game in a rush over 3 days, (with a few minor edits later), in order to have it finished before the con, since my original project wasn't gonna get done in time.
i've heavily commented the code after the fact to document my thoughts about it, and what it does, for those who are interested.

much of the code and architecture of this game was adapted from a previous project of mine, [noodleswoops](https://henlo-birb.itch.io/noodleswoops).

aside from the menu and the dialogue, this game is made entirely in a 2d fragment shader, using ray marching to render the 3d space.<br>
for a primer on ray marching, i'd recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svLzmFuSBhk&t=300s) video by CodeParade or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtv-dBi2wE&t=889s) video by The Art of Code 

ray marching code and algorithms used here are derived from work by Inigo Quillez, CodeParade, and The Art of Code.<br>
